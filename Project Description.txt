The program would work in the following way:
First, we set the time slots that needs to be filled and specify extra requirements 
(such as number of workers required for each slot, the number of times a worker needs to work, etc.) 
Then, we want to have input from members for their names and their availability.  
The scheduler will generate one or more possible solutions. 
If no possible schedule exists, which means there would always be some time slots
that could not match with any worker’s availability, there will also be a warning 
notification printed above the schedule saying “No Complete Schedule Possible”.
